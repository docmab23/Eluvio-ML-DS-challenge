# Eluvio-ML-DS-challenge

This repository includes the submission for the challenge by Eluvio.
I have done variety of things here:
1. EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
2. Sentiment analysis of the Headlines using TextBlob
3. Used the sentiment analytics results to predict the number of upvotes(Didn't get a good result)
4. Preprocessed the textual data 
5. Created a Word2Vec (Skip-gram) model using Gensim for the "Headlines"
6. Analyzed and Visualized the model.
7. Created a Neural-network model (with an Embedding layer and LSTM layer)
to predict the number of Up-votes
8. Created a Bag-of-words representation of the initial 10,000 headlines 
9. Used this Representation to train a Xgboost Regressor model to predict the number of Upvotes(Done on the other notebook)
